Debater for Measure A:

Measure A, known as the San Francisco Affordable Housing Bonds, involves the issuance of $300 million in general obligation bonds to finance affordable housing projects across a range of incomes from extremely low-income to moderate-income households. The purpose of these bonds is to construct, develop, acquire, or rehabilitate various forms of housing, including workforce housing and senior housing, while maintaining oversight through independent citizen audits and a duration of up to 30 years from issuance. It's projected that the average tax rate would be $0.0057 per $100 of assessed property value, with average annual revenues of $25 million.

My stance in support of Measure A is predicated on the necessity to address the pressing housing affordability crisis in San Francisco. The funds from these bonds would enable significant investment into new rental housing development, preservation of existing affordable housing, and specialized housing for those who have experienced trauma such as street violence or domestic abuse. This measure responsibly manages the City's borrowing capacity and includes provisions for oversight, such as the Citizens’ General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee, to ensure that the funds are spent appropriately. A "YES" vote on Measure A represents a commitment to improving housing affordability and supporting the diverse community of San Francisco.

Debater against Measure A:

While the intentions behind Measure A aim to address the housing crisis in San Francisco through the construction, development, acquisition, and rehabilitation of affordable housing, my opposition stems from concerns about fiscal responsibility and potential unintended consequences. Measure A proposes the issuance of $300 million in general obligation bonds, which would inevitably lead to increased property taxes---with an estimated average tax rate of $0.0057 per $100 of assessed property value and the highest estimated annual property tax cost for the owner of a home with an assessed value of $700,000 being approximately $55.00.

The concern is that such a significant financial initiative may burden taxpayers and could prompt rent increases, as landlords are permitted to pass through up to 50% of any resulting property tax increase to tenants. This could exacerbate the affordability crisis for some residents rather than alleviate it. Moreover, the proposal relies on the assumption that the bond issuance will align with the retirement of older bonds and city growth, but if these projections are inaccurate, the fiscal impact could be more severe. Therefore, a "NO" vote on Measure A indicates caution in undertaking substantial debt obligations without clearer guarantees of affordability and stability for all San Francisco residents.

Debater for Measure A:

In response to the concerns posed by the opposition regarding fiscal responsibility and unintended consequences, it's important to highlight that Measure A is designed with a responsible financial structure in mind. The City's policy to limit borrowing by issuing new bonds only as prior bonds are paid off ensures that the financial impact is mitigated over time, and does not place an undue burden on the taxpayers. Additionally, the estimated average tax rate increase is relatively minimal when considering the substantial benefits of increased affordable housing. The $55.00 per year estimate for a $700,000 property is a modest investment in the greater good and long-term stability of our community.

Furthermore, the possibility of landlords passing through a portion of the property tax increase to tenants is a concern the city is aware of and has factored into its decision-making. City policymakers believe that the benefits outweigh this risk, especially given that many of those who are most in need will be the very individuals benefiting from the new affordable housing projects funded by Measure A.

A novel argument in favor of Measure A is the broader economic benefit that can be realized through investment in affordable housing. Construction and rehabilitation of housing stimulate local economies by creating jobs and supporting industries related to housing and construction. Moreover, providing affordable housing can reduce the strain on public services by stabilizing living conditions for low-income households, potentially lowering healthcare, social services, and law enforcement costs.

Lastly, Measure A is not only a financial proposition but a moral commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and equality. By voting 'YES' on Measure A, we are taking a stand for those who are struggling to make ends meet in a city with one of the highest costs of living in the country. It's an investment in our fellow residents' lives, ensuring that San Francisco continues to be a city that welcomes and supports individuals and families across the income spectrum.

Debater against Measure A:

While the proponents of Measure A highlight its potential economic benefits and commitments to social inclusion, these projections do not guarantee that the resulting housing will be distributed equally or that it will reach those in dire need in a timely manner. The creation of these housing units will take significant time to complete, during which many residents may still experience housing insecurity. Furthermore, the economic stimulation arguments often overlook the potential for cost overruns and delays that frequently accompany large public works projects.

The opposition's concern about the potential for rent increases due to landlords passing through a percentage of the property tax increase is not trivial. Even if only a portion of the increase is passed through to tenants, for many low-income renters, even a slight increase in their rent can make a substantial difference in their ability to afford basic necessities. This undermines the very aim of the measure, which is to alleviate the affordability crisis.

Another novel point to consider is the issue of accountability. While independent citizen oversight and regular audits are planned, the history of public bond measures has shown that implementation often strays from initial promises. Without concrete and enforceable mechanisms in place to ensure that the funds from Measure A are used efficiently and effectively, there is a risk that the money could be misallocated or fail to produce the intended outcomes within the projected timeframes.

Moreover, adding such a substantial amount of new public debt has implications for the city's financial health and its ability to respond to future crises. In the event of an economic downturn or another unforeseen event, the additional debt from Measure A could limit fiscal flexibility and put essential public services at risk. It is crucial for the city to maintain a robust financial buffer rather than committing to new large-scale expenditure.

Conclusively, a "NO" vote on Measure A reflects a prudent approach to city planning and fiscal management. The existing housing and social issues in San Francisco require targeted and efficient solutions, and we should seek out alternatives that provide immediate relief without imposing long-term debts on our community.

Debater for Measure A:

In closing, I reaffirm my support for Measure A, which proposes a responsible and necessary step towards addressing San Francisco's affordable housing crisis. This measure represents a strategic investment in the future of our city, ensuring that it remains a vibrant, inclusive community where individuals and families from a diversity of economic backgrounds can find stable and secure housing. The proposed $300 million in general obligation bonds come with a structured oversight plan, including independent citizen audits, guaranteeing that funds will be allocated transparently and effectively towards much-needed housing projects.

The economic and social benefits of Measure A extend beyond immediate housing relief; it's an investment in job creation, economic growth, and community stability. The fiscal impact is carefully calibrated against the city's repayment capacity with an incremental tax increase that is manageable for the majority of homeowners.

Housing is a human right, and by voting 'YES' on Measure A, we are not only investing in bricks and mortar but also in the people who make San Francisco the wonderfully diverse and thriving city that it is. This measure upholds our core values of compassion and social equity, and it empowers us to take a significant leap forward in ensuring that all our residents have a place to call home. Let's join together to build a better, fairer, and more affordable San Francisco for everyone .

Debater against Measure A:

In conclusion, my stance against Measure A lies in a commitment to prudent fiscal management and a more immediate, targeted approach to solving San Francisco's housing issues. Measure A, while well-intentioned, places a significant financial burden on the taxpayers and could lead to higher rents for tenants—the very group it seeks to help—due to landlords passing on increased property taxes. The long-term implications of adding $300 million in debt, and the inevitable complexities and challenges in public works spending, far outweigh the potential benefits.

San Francisco must certainly address its housing crisis, but this must be done through efficient, transparent initiatives that immediately impact those in need without causing financial stress on current and future generations. There is a genuine risk that the bond measure's proposed projects will not efficiently serve those most in need due to the complexities of public spending and the slow process of construction efforts.

By voting 'NO' on Measure A, we call for more precise solutions, ones that do not involve increasing the tax burden or adding to public debt. We look to safeguard the financial stability of our city and to prepare for any future crises without the added pressure of repaying substantial bond obligations. Let's work towards a path of fiscal responsibility and ensure that investments in our city are both effective and economically sound.
