Moderator: Please concisely summarize Measure a and your stance on it

Debater for Measure A:

Measure A is an ordinance proposing the issuance of $300 million in general obligation bonds aimed at addressing San Francisco's pressing need for affordable housing. The funds will be used to construct, develop, acquire, and rehabilitate various forms of housing, including rental units for extremely low to moderate-income households, senior and workforce housing, as well as housing for those experiencing trauma related to homelessness. This measure is subject to stringent oversight by an independent citizen committee and regular audits to ensure transparency and accountability.

My stance in support of Measure A is grounded in the belief that every resident of San Francisco deserves access to safe, stable, and affordable housing. This initiative not only aims to provide housing for those most in need but also ensures that the financial burden on taxpayers is manageable. With an estimated tax rate increase of $0.0057 per $100 of assessed property value, the projection for the highest estimated annual tax cost for a homeowner with a property assessed at $700,000 would be approximately $55.00. Measure A represents a balanced approach to tackle the housing affordability crisis in San Francisco, which is why I strongly support its approval.

Debater against Measure A:

I oppose Measure A, the ordinance to issue $300 million in general obligation bonds for the purpose of creating more affordable housing in San Francisco. While the goal of expanding affordable housing options for extremely low-income to moderate-income households is laudable, the method of funding through increasing property tax burdens raises substantial concerns.

The proposed funding will result in an estimated average tax rate of $0.0057 per $100 of assessed property value and potentially an annual property tax cost of $55.00 for a home assessed at $700,000. This may seem relatively small, but it can add up over time and have a more significant impact on taxpayers, especially during economic downturns or for those on fixed incomes.

There is also the broader issue of fiscal responsibility and existing resources. Before allocating such a substantial amount of additional money through bond measures—which ultimately have to be paid back with interest—we should thoroughly assess the efficiency and effectiveness with which current funds are used.

While the measure includes provisions for independent citizen oversight and regular audits, past experiences with such oversight mechanisms have not always guaranteed the prevention of mismanagement or misuse of funds.

In summary, while addressing the affordable housing crisis is crucial, Measure A may impose an unfair tax burden on property owners and does not necessarily ensure the best return on investment for taxpayers. Alternative solutions that do not rely on raising taxes or increasing public debt should be explored to address this complex issue.

Debater for Measure A:

In response to the concerns posed by my opponent, I would argue that the tax increase posed by Measure A is not only minimal but a necessary investment in our city's future. An increase of approximately $55 per year for a property valued at $700,000 is a modest price to pay to address the housing crisis that affects all residents of San Francisco, directly or indirectly. As housing becomes more affordable, the entire community benefits through decreases in homelessness, stabilization of neighborhoods, and increased economic activity. This measure is an investment that will strengthen the social fabric of our city.

Moreover, the stringent oversight by the Citizens’ General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee and regular audits are critical components of the measure that demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability. While no system is infallible, the independent audits and citizen oversight provide a framework to minimize the risk of mismanagement or misuse of funds more effectively than many past strategies.

It's also important to consider the legal imperative behind Measure A. State law requires San Francisco to construct a significant number of affordable housing units by 2031 to avoid penalties. The state's contribution falls short of what is needed, and this measure provides a mechanism for the city to meet its obligations efficiently without solely relying on other unpredictable funding sources or incurring potential penalties.

Introducing new arguments, I would also point to the broader economic benefits that come with investing in affordable housing. Research has demonstrated that every dollar spent on building affordable housing contributes to local economies by supporting jobs in construction and related industries, increasing disposable income, and promoting further economic activity.

Additionally, not addressing the affordable housing crisis with proactive steps like those proposed in Measure A can lead to greater long-term costs for the city. As housing remains inaccessible to low and moderate-income families, we could see increased demands on social services, higher healthcare costs resulting from housing instability, and a negative impact on educational outcomes for children growing up in uncertain living conditions. Therefore, the cost of inaction could far exceed the investment proposed by Measure A.

Debater against Measure A:

In response to the arguments presented in favor of Measure A, I would like to emphasize that while affordable housing is indeed a crucial issue, the means of achieving this through increased taxation requires careful scrutiny. The modest tax increase presented may not feel impactful to some, but it can impose a significant cumulative burden on property owners, especially in a city with an already high cost of living. Furthermore, not every property owner is equally equipped to absorb these increases, and the measure permits landlords to pass through up to 50% of any property tax increase to tenants, which may inadvertently affect the very individuals it intends to help.

While the goal of constructing and maintaining affordable housing units is essential, we cannot ignore the potential for bureaucratic inefficiencies and cost overruns inherent in large-scale government projects. The oversight committee, while intended to act as a safeguard, may not fully prevent issues that historically accompany large public expenditures. There's also the risk of creating long-term debt obligations that could constrain the city's budget in future years, particularly when faced with unforeseeable economic challenges.

Continuing on novel arguments, it is important to consider the potential market distortions that can arise from government intervention in the housing market. The creation of affordable housing through bond measures may inadvertently affect the housing market by disincentivizing private sector investment and development. There's a delicate balance between providing affordable housing and allowing the market to respond to demand, and heavy-handed approaches can lead to unintended consequences.

We should instead explore more holistic and sustainable solutions that involve a mix of incentives for private developers, responsible zoning reforms, and efficient use of existing housing funds. Furthermore, we need to address underlying causes of the housing crisis, such as income inequality, the cost of living, and regional planning issues, which a bond measure alone cannot solve.

Lastly, by tying the city's hands financially through long-term bonds, we may limit our ability to respond to other pressing issues requiring fiscal resources. The city should focus on making smart, strategic investments that do rather than embarking on borrowing large sums that future generations will be responsible for repaying.

In light of the diverse range of economic and social considerations, Measure A, while well-intentioned, presents risks and drawbacks that appear to outweigh its potential benefits.

Debater for Measure A:

In conclusion, the enactment of Measure A is an essential step toward tackling the critical shortage of affordable housing in San Francisco. It offers a practical and timely response to a complex problem that will have profoundly positive implications for all residents of the city, especially for the most vulnerable populations.

The measure's funding will go directly into constructing, developing, acquiring, and rehabilitating housing that is affordable to low and moderate-income households. The direct impact will be an increase in available housing, which is vital to ensure the inclusivity and diversity of our community.

Furthermore, the oversight and audit provisions within the measure ensure that funds are allocated responsibly and efficiently. While no measure is without risk, the transparent process set forth by Measure A provides a layer of accountability that serves the public interest.

The cost, represented by a slight tax increase, is a responsible and sustainable investment in our city and must be weighed against the substantial social and economic benefits of providing affordable housing. The failure to act now will only exacerbate the housing crisis and result in higher indirect costs over time due to increased demand for social services, worsened public health outcomes, and a potential increase in homelessness.

Measure A is not just a financial proposition; it is a moral imperative. In a city as prosperous as San Francisco, it is unacceptable for individuals and families to be without stable, secure housing. By voting in favor of Measure A, we are affirming our commitment to equity, community resilience, and the welfare of all San Franciscans now and into the future.

Debater against Measure A:

In closing, while the intentions behind Measure A are commendable in addressing San Francisco's affordable housing crisis, the approach of increasing property tax to fund this initiative is fundamentally flawed. It places an undue burden on taxpayers, including those it aims to help, with no guaranteed resolution to the systemic issues that have fueled the housing shortfall.

The measure's reliance on new government debt to finance these projects raises significant concerns about fiscal responsibility and the potential for cost overruns and mismanagement, despite the proposed oversight. Moreover, saddling future generations with the debt incurred today may hinder the city’s financial flexibility and ability to address other unforeseen challenges ahead.

It's imperative to explore alternative strategies that encourage a more sustainable housing market and broader economic growth, such as incentivizing private development, implementing more effective zoning reforms, and better utilizing existing resources before resorting to measures that increase public debt.

Given the high costs of living and the complexity of the housing crisis in San Francisco, a multi-faceted approach that engages both the public and private sectors is essential. We should strive for solutions that address the root causes and bring about long-term stability without imposing additional financial pressures on our citizens.

For these reasons, I urge a vote against Measure A. We must demand a more thoughtful, comprehensive plan that ensures affordability and sustainability for the housing market without compromising the economic well-being of San Francisco's property owners and taxpayers.
